A macOS app to jump start the download of Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon Macs.

## What do I do?

Well when I first loaded up my Macbook Pro with the first M1 chip inside, I needed to install Rosetta 2 to run the terminal in "Intel Mode."

My normal everyday apps for the most part are already running on the M1.  Rather than download a large app just to install Rosetta 2 and then immediately delete it, I could have used a smaller app.

Therefore I created a pretty basic macOS app that was compiled using the "Intel architecture" to kick start the Rosetta 2 install if I need in the future.  It's only ~117 KB of app to download.

## How to use

Either export the app from the Xcode project, or download the version attached in releases.
